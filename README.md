# CS300-Portfolio

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
A big part of the Data Structures and Algroithms class was spent going over different algorithms used in computer science. We learned how they worked, when the best time to use them were, and then discussed Big O Notation and how to calculate the "cost" of an algorithm. Project One was understanding the differnt "costs" of running each algorithm for the program we were developing. Project Two was to build the program to store, organize, and search the data read in from a CSV file.


### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I decided to use a binary search tree to build the program. From Project One, it had the best runtime analysis and would take less lines of code to write to complete the requirements. 


### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I felt like I had a solid base set up from my pseudocode when I started to build the program. If I ran into any issues I utalized Google to answer my questions or the tutoring service which was very helpful in explaining errors to me.


### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I think this project really helped solidify why writing pseudocode is a good idea before starting to develop. I also have a deeper understanding of different algorithms and why we should have many in the toolkit instead of just one.


### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I always try and make sure my code is commented well. I learn more and more as I see how others develop and their code, so the example files we used were very helpful for seeing other commenting styles. I also used class files in Project Two because I felt that everything was too cluttered in one file.
